DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       rreeaaddppsstt is a program that can read an Outlook PST (Personal Folders)
       file and convert it into an mbox file, a format suitable for KMail, a
       recursive mbox structure, or separate emails.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -C _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_-_c_h_a_r_s_e_t
           Set the character set to be used for items with an unspecified
           character set.

       -D
           Include deleted items in the output.

       -M
           Output messages in MH (rfc822) format as separate files. This will
           create folders as named in the PST file, and will put each email
           together with any attachments into its own file. These files will
           be numbered from 1 to n with no leading zeros. This format has no
           from quoting.

       -S
           Output messages into separate files. This will create folders as
           named in the PST file, and will put each email in its own file.
           These files will be numbered from 1 to n with no leading zeros.
           Attachments will also be saved in the same folder as the email
           message. The attachments for message $m are saved as $m-$name where
           $name is (the original name of the attachment, or 'attach$n' if the
           attachment had no name), where $n is another sequential index with
           no leading zeros. This format has no from quoting.

       -V
           Show program version and exit.

       -a _a_t_t_a_c_h_m_e_n_t_-_e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n_-_l_i_s_t
           Set the list of acceptable attachment extensions. Any attachment
           that does not have an extension on this list will be discarded. All
           attachments are acceptable if the list is empty, or this option is
           not specified.

       -b
           Do not save the attachments for the RTF format of the email body.

       -c _f_o_r_m_a_t
           Set the Contact output mode. Use -cv for vcard format or -cl for an
           email list.

       -d _d_e_b_u_g_-_f_i_l_e
           Specify name of debug log file. The log file is now an ascii file,
           instead of the binary file used in previous versions.

       -e
           Same as the M option, but each output file will include an
           extension from (.eml, .ics, .vcf). This format has no from quoting.

       -h
           Show summary of options and exit.

       -j _j_o_b_s
           Specifies the maximum number of parallel jobs. Specify 0 to
           suppress running parallel jobs. Folders may be processed in
           parallel. Output formats that place each mail message in a separate
           file (-M, -S, -e) may process the contents of individual folders in
           parallel.

       -k
           Changes the output format to KMail. This format uses mboxrd from
           quoting.

       -m
           Same as the e option, but write .msg files also

       -o _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
           Specifies the output directory. The directory must already exist,
           and is entered after the PST file is opened, but before any
           processing of files commences.

       -q
           Changes to silent mode. No feedback is printed to the screen,
           except for error messages.

       -r
           Changes the output format to Recursive. This will create folders as
           named in the PST file, and will put all emails in a file called
           "mbox" inside each folder. These files are then compatible with all
           mbox-compatible email clients. This format uses mboxrd from
           quoting.

       -t _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_t_y_p_e_-_c_o_d_e_s
           Specifies the item types that are processed. The argument is a
           sequence of single letters from (e,a,j,c) for (email, appointment,
           journal, contact) types. The default is to process all item types.

       -u
           Sets Thunderbird mode, a submode of recursive mode. This causes two
           extra .type and .size meta files to be created. This format uses
           mboxrd from quoting.

       -w
           Overwrite any previous output files. Beware: When used with the -S
           switch, this will remove all files from the target folder before
           writing. This is to keep the count of emails and attachments
           correct.

FFRROOMM QQUUOOTTIINNGG
       Output formats that place each mail message in a separate file (-M, -S,
       -e, -m) don't do any from quoting. Output formats that place multiple
       email messages in a single file (-k, -r, -u) now use mboxrd from
       quoting rules. If none of those switches are specified, the default
       output format uses mboxrd from quoting rules, since it produces
       multiple email messages in a single file. Earlier versions used mboxo
       from quoting rules for all output formats.
