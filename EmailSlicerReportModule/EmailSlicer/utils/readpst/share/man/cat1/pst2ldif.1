       -V
           Show program version. Subsequent options are then ignored.

       -b _l_d_a_p_-_b_a_s_e
           Sets the ldap base value used in the dn records. You probably want
           to use something like "o=organization, c=US".

       -c _c_l_a_s_s
           Sets the objectClass values for the contact items. This class needs
           to be defined in the schema used by your LDAP server, and at a
           minimum it must contain the ldap attributes given below. This
           option may be specified multiple times to generate entries with
           multiple object classes.

       -d _d_e_b_u_g_-_f_i_l_e
           Specify name of debug log file. The log file is now an ascii file,
           instead of the binary file used in previous versions.

       -l _e_x_t_r_a_-_l_i_n_e
           Specify an extra line to be added to each ldap entry. This option
           may be specified multiple times to add multiple lines to each ldap
           entry.

       -o
           Use the old ldap schema, rather than the default new ldap schema.
           The old schema generates multiple postalAddress attributes for a
           single entry. The new schema generates a single postalAddress (and
           homePostalAddress when available) attribute with $ delimiters as
           specified in RFC4517. Using the old schema also generates two extra
           leading entries, one for "dn:ldap base", and one for "dn: cn=root,
           ldap base".

       -h
           Show summary of options. Subsequent options are then ignored.

       ppsstt22llddiiff reads the contact information from a MS Outlook .pst file and
       produces a .ldif file that may be used to import those contacts into an
       LDAP database. The following ldap attributes are generated for the old
       ldap schema:
           cn
           givenName
           sn
           personalTitle
